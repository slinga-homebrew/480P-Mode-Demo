# 480P Mode Demo
Decompilation attempt of Charles MacDonald's 480P Mode demo for the Sega Saturn. The original ISO is available here: https://segaxtreme.net/threads/progressive-hires-test-demo.15539/. This code allows you to try a number of different resolutions on the Saturn. I don't plan to clean up the code as I want to keep it as close as possible to to the original binary. 

Build the code with joengine or grab an ISO from [releases](https://github.com/slinga-homebrew/480P-Mode-demo/releases).

## Issues
I couldn't get this program to run under Mednafen. On Yabuse most of the resolutions worked as expected but the high resolution 480P resolutions are corrupted. On real hardware the code appears to work. I have only tested with an RGB SCART connected to an OSSC. I would like to test with HD Retrovision cables directly to a TV at some point.
