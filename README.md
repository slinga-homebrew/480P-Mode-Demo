# 480P Mode Demo
Work-in-progress decompilation attempt of Charles MacDonald's 480P Mode demo for the Sega Saturn. The original ISO is available here: https://segaxtreme.net/threads/progressive-hires-test-demo.15539/. This code allows you to try a number of different resolutions on the Saturn. I don't plan to clean up the code as I want to keep it as close as possible to to the original binary. 

Build the code with joengine or grab an ISO from [releases](https://github.com/slinga-homebrew/480P-Mode-demo/releases).

## Issues
The decompiled code appears to work the same as the original binary on Yabuse 0.9.14. On Yabause 0.9.15, Mednafen, and real hardware the decompiled code is not functioning correctly.
